<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This post is a continuation of my experiments using TeamCity&#8217;s Kotlin DSL that I started in my
<a href="https://rodm.github.com/blog/2017/03/teamcity-versioned-settings.html">previous post</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this post I cover adding multiple build configurations to a project and explore the different ways that can be
achieved, from simple copy and paste to using base build types and build templates.
Then I cover adding build features and build failure conditions to the build configurations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last few sections cover triggering a build when the settings change, the Maven plugin and a Gradle plugin. The
Maven plugin has a generate goal that provides some checking and reporting of any problems in the DSL.
The Gradle plugin is a plugin that I&#8217;ve developed that provides similar functionality to the Maven plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I started my experiments I hadn&#8217;t read the documentation only the series of
<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2016/11/kotlin-configuration-scripts-an-introduction/">posts</a> on the TeamCity blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first page in the documentation <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Storing+Project+Settings+in+Version+Control">Storing Project Settings in Version Control</a> covers
the setup of using versioned settings and synchronizing the settings with a VCS. It also covers the implications
of storing secure data such as passwords. The section on Displaying Changes covers triggering builds on settings
changes that I discuss later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Kotlin+DSL">Kotlin DSL</a> page covers the advantages of using the Kotlin DSL, how to download the current
settings in a Kotlin format, working with the Kotlin DSL and setting up an IDE. It then covers making changes
to the settings and applying those changes to a TeamCity server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Upgrading+DSL">Upgrading DSL</a> page covers the changes that have been made to the DSL between the 10.0 version
and the next release 2017.1. There are quite a number of changes, possibly a sign that the DSL is still being
developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first two pages are useful for setting up a server to use versioned settings in the Kotlin format and
setting up an IDE to make changes but there is no DSL reference so not something that will be referred to a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the Kotlin DSL page there is a claim that it makes discovery of the available API options much simpler.
It is easy to find methods and fields but it is not easy to map a field to the equivalent field in the UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The documentation explains the purpose of the identifiers and the effect of changing a <code>uuid</code> on build configurations
and projects but it doesn&#8217;t explain why <code>extId</code> and <code>uuid</code> are required and can&#8217;t be derived from the name.
There is a section that recommends setting up unit tests for testing the DSL, but no example is provided, however
there is an example in the last post of the blog series mentioned earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a recommendation to put the project settings in a separate VCS repository, I&#8217;ve used <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> and
<a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a> and like the idea of keeping the settings with the code. There are good reasons to use a separate
repository if passwords or other secure data maybe contained in the settings. One downside to this is having to tag
and branch the repositories together if you ever need to rebuild an older version.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="kotlin_gradle_plugin">Kotlin Gradle plugin</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I was writing the <a href="https://rodm.github.com/blog/2017/03/teamcity-versioned-settings.html">previous post</a> I realised I was using the Java plugin, so I
changed the build to use the Kotlin plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-groovy" data-lang="groovy">buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.0.3'
        classpath 'com.github.rodm:gradle-teamcity-plugin:0.11'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'kotlin'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this changed was that the <code>Project.kt</code> file would be compiled by the plugin so it provided some compile time
checking that the code was valid but the <code>settings.kts</code> file was not compiled. This was a small
improvement over the 'java' plugin that didn&#8217;t compile either of the files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the Maven plugin does compile the <code>settings.kts</code> file but only if there is also a file with a <code>kt</code> extension
in the package.
There is a bit more to the <a href="#maven_plugin">Maven plugin</a> that I discuss later.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="multiple_build_configurations">Multiple build configurations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before adding more build configurations I wanted to see if all the settings, project, build type and version control
could be stored in the <code>settings.kts</code> file rather than spread out over many files. This does work but it means
that neither the <code>java</code> plugin or the <code>kotlin</code> plugin will compile the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fully build and test the <a href="https://github.com/rodm/gradle-teamcity-plugin">Gradle TeamCity plugin</a>, the project used to test the TeamCity Kotlin DSL, it is
built and tested using Java 7 and Java 8, there are also 2 build configurations that run functional tests again using
Java 7 and Java 8, then there is a build configuration to run the builds in the samples directory.
Finally there is a code quality build configuration that runs the <code>sonarqube</code> task.
The list of build configurations is as follows:-</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build - Java 7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build - Java 8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functional Test - Java 7</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functional Test - Java 8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report - Code Quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samples Test - Java 7</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The differences between the build configurations can be achieved by setting the Gradle tasks and the Java home
parameters, except for the Code Quality build, this requires an additional property <code>gradle.opts</code> that is used
to provide the host URL for the SonarQube server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next few sections discuss the different ways I&#8217;ve tried using the Kotlin DSL to create the above
build configurations.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="copy_paste_build_types">Copy &amp; Paste build types</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first approach I took was just to copy and paste the code that creates a build type and modify it for each of the
build configurations listed above. Each build type required a new value for the <code>name</code>, <code>extId</code> and <code>uuid</code> properties.
For the different <code>uuid</code> values I copied the existing build&#8217;s value and changed the last character.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For builds running unit tests the <code>gradle.tasks</code> parameter was set to <code>clean build</code> for functional tests it was set
to <code>clean functionalTest</code>, for the samples test it was set to <code>clean samplesTest</code> and for the code quality build it
was set to <code>clean build sonarqube</code>.
For builds using Java 7 the <code>java.home</code> parameter was set to <code>%java7.home%</code> and for Java 8 it was set to <code>%java8.home%</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the code
<a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/d957834e4dc35ef061ce5f02b3d5c2a1bbb3510f/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L66-L95">settings.kts</a>
with the repeated block highlighted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="replace_duplicated_code_with_functions">Replace duplicated code with functions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next approach was to refactor the common code into functions. I created two functions <code>createBuildType</code> and
<code>configureBuildType</code>. The first function creates a build type with the <code>name</code>, <code>extId</code> and <code>uuid</code> properties set,
the second function uses Kotlin&#8217;s <code>apply</code> function to configure each built type with a VCS root, a Gradle build step,
a VCS trigger and the Gradle tasks and Java home parameters. This reduced the <code>settings.kts</code> file by about 70 lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code can be seen at the following links, <a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/cd18ac6099ee357528cb4736bf72dd00d4569dad/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L66-L68">build type</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/cd18ac6099ee357528cb4736bf72dd00d4569dad/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L94-L100">createBuildType</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/cd18ac6099ee357528cb4736bf72dd00d4569dad/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L102-L130">configureBuildType</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="base_build_types">Base build types</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While writing the above code I noticed that the constructor for <code>BuiltType</code> takes an optional parameter, <code>base</code>, that
is another <code>BuildType</code>. The comment for the constructor indicates that if <code>base</code> is not null the settings are copied
from it to the new <code>BuildType</code>. So this provides another way of creating build configurations using shared code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code for the base type can be seen here, <a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/d50402d4c1a7c717b34a9ff6adf3797a96409a1d/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L73-L119">base build type</a>, and the creation
of a build type using it can be seen here, <a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/d50402d4c1a7c717b34a9ff6adf3797a96409a1d/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L121-L125">build type</a>.
Additionally parts of the configuration can be overridden within the lambda, as seen here,
<a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/d50402d4c1a7c717b34a9ff6adf3797a96409a1d/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L148-L159">build type with overrides</a>,
the timeout is changed and the parameters have different values set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve not tried it but it should be possible to construct a base build type based on another base build type, possibly
reducing further the amount of code required to create multiple build configurations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code for base build types seems to create more readable code, some of the lines in the previous example were
too long.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="build_template">Build template</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a build template is similar to the base <code>BuildType</code> discussed in the previous section, a <code>Template</code> is created
with the settings for a build configuration, then one or more <code>BuildType</code> s are created using the template. One
noticeable difference in the code, when exporting a template from TeamCity, is that there are more <code>id</code> s, build steps,
VCS triggers, and build features all have an <code>id</code>. This is to allow build configurations to override settings using
the <code>id</code> to refer to the configuration in the template. I&#8217;ve found that the <code>id</code> s can be removed, without causing a
problem, if they are not used to provide any additional configuration to a <code>BuildType</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following link shows the
<a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/template/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L74-L127">build template</a>
and this link shows a
<a href="https://github.com/rodm/teamcity-settings/blob/template/.teamcity/GradleTeamCityPlugin/settings.kts#L129-L134">build type</a> using it</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is little to choose between using base build types and build templates when looking at the Kotlin DSL but
there is a difference with the XML files created by both. The base build type creates XML files that contain all the
configuration for the build type where as the build type using a template contains essentially only the differences
from the template, name, external id, uuid and any overrides.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="build_configuration">Build configuration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next sections will cover some of the parts of a build configuration or build template, to add build features,
failure conditions and a build trigger when the settings change.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="build_features">Build features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first feature I added to the build configuration was to use the Performance Monitor during a build, this feature
is possibly one of the simplest to add, it has no configuration and the following code enables it.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    feature {
        id = "perfmon"
        type = "perfmon"
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next feature I tried was more complex, a shared resource, it is configured at the project level and
for each build configuration that uses it. In my example a 'Resource with quota' called 'BuildLimit' is created
with a quota of '2', this will limit the number of concurrent builds using the resource to 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following code shows how a shared resource is configured for a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Project level feature configuration</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">project {
    features {
        feature {
            id = "PROJECT_EXT_2"
            type = "JetBrains.SharedResources"
            param("name", "BuildLimit")
            param("type", "quoted")
            param("quota", "2")
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following code shows how a build configuration uses a shared resource</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Build type feature configuration</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    features {
        feature {
            id = "BUILD_EXT_2"
            type = "JetBrains.SharedResources"
            param("locks-param", "BuildLimit readLock")
        }
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the configuration and usage of a resource is done using strings, there are no hints on what the names or values
could be, the only way is to configure a build and to export it. The XML Reporting plugin has the same problem
there are many reports supported and each has different configuration parameters that can only be found by configuring
a build using the UI and exporting it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While <code>id</code> s are not necessary they are useful to override a configuration in a template. For example to disable
a feature the <code>enabled</code> property can be set to false with the <code>id</code> of the feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    features {
        feature {
            id = "BUILD_EXT_2"
            enabled = false
        }
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A more convenient method is available, the function <code>disableSettings</code> can be called with a variable list of ids
of the features to be disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    features {
        disableSettings("perfmon", "BUILD_EXT_2")
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While not a build a feature I noticed that re-ordering build steps requires creating an ArrayList with the ids
of the build steps in the order that they are to be executed. There is no equivalent method to <code>disableSettings</code>
for the build steps order, so the API is inconsistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    steps {
        ....
        stepsOrder = arrayListOf("RUNNER_2", "RUNNER_1", "RUNNER_3")
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="failure_conditions">Failure conditions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only failure condition setting I typically make on a build configuration is to set a build timeout, and in this
example I set it to 10 minutes.
I&#8217;ve included all the properties that are available in the code below with their default values.
These were easy to discover within my IDE.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    failureConditions {
        executionTimeoutMin = 10
        nonZeroExitCode = true
        testFailure = true
        errorMessage = false
        javaCrash = true
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the above settings are easy to discover and set, additional failure conditions based on metrics or build log
messages are harder to configure using the API alone. Again setting up a build configuration with the failure
condition and then exporting the project from TeamCity in Kotlin format is the best option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The example below shows a failure condition on a metric change, the enumerations for the various fields
looks ugly, it would be cleaner if the values could be specified without the enclosing classes.
It is also not easy to know which properties are required and which are optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    failOnMetricChange {
        metric = BuildFailureOnMetric.MetricType.ARTIFACT_SIZE
        units = BuildFailureOnMetric.MetricUnit.DEFAULT_UNIT
        comparison = BuildFailureOnMetric.MetricComparison.MORE
        compareTo = build {
            buildRule = lastPinned()
        }
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="triggering_a_build_when_settings_change">Triggering a build when settings change</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the Versioned Settings page there is a <strong>Change Log</strong> view that shows the changes made to the settings, it only
shows changes made under the <code>.teamcity</code> directory. I wanted changes to the settings to trigger a build, it&#8217;s
possible a build failure is due to a configuration change.
Following the <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Storing+Project+Settings+in+Version+Control#StoringProjectSettingsinVersionControl-DisplayingChanges">documentation</a>
I added the following to the VCS trigger.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    triggers {

         }
     }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This didn&#8217;t cause builds to trigger due to a settings change, so I changed the VCS root name to, <code>TeamcitySettings</code>
this also didn&#8217;t trigger any builds. After adding the VCS root to the build configuration and then reading the
documentation about trigger rules I eventually found that the following worked.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key was changing the file path wildcard pattern from '*' to '**', also both the VCS roots for the settings and
the project have to be included otherwise only changes to one VCS root will trigger a build.</p>

<p>I mentioned above that I added the settings VCS root to the build configuration, I had to revert that change,
the settings VCS root resulted in the project code being checked out then removed for the settings checkout.
So the build configuration has only the VCS root for the project and not the settings VCS root, this works despite
the reference in the trigger rules.
Although this causes TeamCity to show a warning in the UI about an un-attached VCS root.</p>

<h2 id="maven_plugin">Maven Plugin</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I initially converted the Maven POM file to a Gradle equivalent I missed the Maven plugin,
<code>teamcity-configs-maven-plugin</code>.
The plugin only gets a brief mention in the
<a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/Kotlin+DSL#KotlinDSL-ChangePasswordsafterSettingsGeneration">documentation</a>
about using it to scramble passwords for updating an existing configuration after a password change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plugin has two goals <code>generate</code> and <code>scramble</code>. The <code>generate</code> goal is interesting, executing this goal compiles
the Kotlin DSL settings and outputs the XML files used by TeamCity into the <code>target/generated-configs</code> directory. If
the DSL files fail to compile or contain an incorrect setting the XML files are not produced and a file
<code>dsl_exception.xml</code> is created listing the problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The example below shows what happens if a build type is created without a <code>uuid</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">dsl_exception.xml</div>

    &lt;info&gt;jetbrains.buildServer.configs.dsl.DslGeneratorProcess.main [41]&lt;/info&gt;
  &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;errors&gt;
    &lt;error type="validation" source="" message="Missing uuid in buildType 'GradleTeamcityPlugin_BuildJava8'" project="GradleTeamCityPlugin" /&gt;

<p>The plugin provides a useful tool to check the settings before committing but there are many cases where it doesn&#8217;t
report a problem. It is possible to use the same <code>uuid</code> for build configurations, there are no checks for build feature
parameters and it doesn&#8217;t catch the import problem I had in the previous post.</p>

<h2 id="gradle_dsl_plugin">Gradle DSL Plugin</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Maven plugin, <code>teamcity-configs-maven-plugin</code>, appears to be a simple adapter that calls into the DSL generator
code that is used by TeamCity.
I decided to try creating a Gradle plugin that does a similar job and the result can be found in this project,
<a href="https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.rodm.teamcity-dsl">gradle-teamcity-dsl-plugin</a>.
The plugin provides a task <code>generateConfiguration</code> that compiles the settings DSL and outputs the XML files
into the <code>build/generated-configs</code> directory and sets up the <code>.teamcity</code> directory as a source set.
It is still a work-in-progress but is quite usable now as an alternative to the Maven plugin.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The documentation provides useful setup information but lacks a good DSL reference like the Gradle DSL reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the DSL to create projects and build configurations is very flexible as shown by the different approaches
I took to create multiple build configurations. I&#8217;m sure one or more of them could be used to setup multiple projects
and possibly hundreds of build configurations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the lack of a good DSL reference the development cycle for creating and editing settings will require using
the TeamCity UI to configure a project or build configuration and to then export it in Kotlin format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I imagine that creating build configurations targeting different platforms, build tools or version control systems
will have some of the same problems I&#8217;ve encountered above and possibly others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A comment in my previous post describes how the code completion menu offers too many options, this was due to
the approach I took of moving all the code into the <code>settings.kts</code> file. I&#8217;m guessing most of the DSL API is in scope
making it more difficult to choose a valid, in scope, method or field. I discovered this after introducing the
functions to create a build type and configure it, within the functions there was less API options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully this post and the <a href="https://rodm.github.com/blog/2017/03/teamcity-versioned-settings.html">previous post</a> have provided some ideas on how to use
TeamCity&#8217;s Kotlin DSL.</p>
